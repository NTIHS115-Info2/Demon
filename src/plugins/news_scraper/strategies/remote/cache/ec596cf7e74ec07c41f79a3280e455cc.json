Certified inGoogle IT Support, my focus is on providing honest product reviews and analysis and fostering a strong gaming community with 130k+ members in PPG.\nNVIDIA announced during the GTC its new top-of-the-range graphics chip aimed at Artificial Intelligence; we are talking aboutBlackwell.\nThis is not only the largest graphics chip in the world, but it manages to increase the performance of what until now wasÂ the most powerful GPU in the world, Hopper (NVIDIA H100), by five.\nThe NVIDIA Blackwell GPU is alsoÂ the first multi-chip designÂ (MCM) graphics chipÂ created by NVIDIA.Â Each Blackwell chip is linked to two Blackwell GPUs. Now, the platform used to bring it to life combines two complete Blackwell chips and an Arm Grace CPU. Letâ€™s look at what NVIDIA Blackwell offers to the industry.\nThe NVIDIA Blackwell GPU is made up ofÂ 208 billion transistors.Â These are 128,000 million more compared to the NVIDIA Hopper chip.Â This chip also incorporatesÂ four times more memoryÂ integrated into the die itself, which translates into offeringÂ up to192 GB of HBM3e memory,Â which, together with an 8,192-bit interface, providesÂ abandwidth of 8 TB/s.\nThis chip is manufactured by TSMC using its4nmÂ 4NP lithography, while each GPU that makes up the Blackwell chip is interconnected through an interface with a bandwidth of 10 TB/s.\nNVIDIA Blackwell comprises 20,480 CUDA Cores, uses 8-layer HBM3e memory chips, and can reach aTDPof up to 700W.Â This TDP is the same as found in the NVIDIA H100 and H200 GPUs.\nNVIDIA Blackwell can deliver AI performance of 20 petaFLOPS, 5 times faster than the NVIDIA H100 chip. The top-of-the-range Hopper chip is aimed at AI-related workloads. As we said, two of these complete chips are accompanied by a Grace CPU to createÂ the NVIDIA HB200 superchip.\nThis Superchip has a CPU with 72 Arm Neoverse V2 cores, two Blackwell GPUs, access to 384 GB of HBM3e memory, and an NVLink-C2C interconnect with a bandwidth of 900 GB/s.\nBelow, you can find the performance numbers of the NVIDIA Blackwell chip compared to the NVIDIA Hopper:\nThanks to these improvements, NVIDIA is confident that Blackwell isÂ themost powerful AI chip in the world.Â This architecture uses theÂ 2nd GenerationÂ Transformer Engine.\nThese feature new microtensor scaling support and NVIDIAâ€™s advanced dynamic range management algorithms built into the NVIDIA TensorRTâ„¢-LLM and NeMo Megatron frameworks.\nThis means BlackwellÂ will support double the compute and model sizesÂ with new 4-bit floating point AI inference capabilities.Â With the 5th Generation of the NVIDIA NVLink interconnect, a bidirectional performance of 1.8 TB/s per GPU is achieved. This ensures seamless high-speed communicationÂ between up to 576 GPUsÂ for the most complex LLMs.\nLatest Updates\nNVIDIA Blackwell GPUs feature AI preventive maintenance. This guarantees reliability, availability, and ease of maintenance. This AI runs diagnostics and helps you predict reliability issues. This maximizes system uptime and improves resiliency so large-scale AI deployments run uninterrupted for weeks or even months. This translates into reducing operating costs.\nThere is no official information on the release date of the NVIDIA Blackwell. However, based on rumors and speculation, they are expected to be launched sometime in late 2024 or early 2025.\nWhat are your thoughts on this new powerful chip for Nvidia aiming towards the new revolution of AI?
