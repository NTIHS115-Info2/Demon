  "description": "Controls physical lights in the IoT system using an IR turret device. Whenever the user's intent involves turning lights on or off, lighting control, or operating any smart light-related device, this tool must be used. The turret will scan and send IR commands to control the lights. The internal IoT logic, device selection, and execution details are handled by the system.",
  "input": {
    "device": "String – Required. Target device type. Supported: 'light', 'fan'.",
    "method": "String – Required. Control method/action. Supported canonical values: 'turn_on', 'turn_off'. Synonyms are allowed (e.g., 'on', 'off', 'open', 'close', '開燈', '關燈')."

  "notes": [
    "The device must be registered and online before this tool can be used.",
    "IR codes are resolved via the IR_CODE_DICT mapping (device -> method -> code).",
